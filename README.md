# üè• Hospital Management ‚Äì Task 5 (SQL Joins)

## Overview
This task demonstrates different types of SQL JOINs using the hospital database schema from Task 1.
The goal is to retrieve combined data from multiple related tables.
---

## JOIN Types Covered
1. **INNER JOIN** ‚Äì Returns only rows with matching values in both tables.
2. **LEFT JOIN** ‚Äì Returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right table.
3. **RIGHT JOIN** ‚Äì Returns all rows from the right table and matched rows from the left table.
4. **FULL OUTER JOIN** ‚Äì Returns all rows when there is a match in either table (MySQL uses `LEFT JOIN` + `UNION` + `RIGHT JOIN` to achieve this).
5. **CROSS JOIN** ‚Äì Returns all possible combinations of rows from both tables (Cartesian product).
6. **SELF JOIN** ‚Äì Joins a table to itself.

## How to Run
1. Ensure your hospital schema from Task 1 is available.
2. Open MySQL Workbench or DB Fiddle.
3. Copy and execute the queries in `task5.sql`.

## Key Concepts
- **INNER JOIN** ‚Üí Use when you only want matching records.
- **LEFT JOIN** ‚Üí Keep all rows from the first table, even if there‚Äôs no match.
- **RIGHT JOIN** ‚Üí Keep all rows from the second table, even if there‚Äôs no match.
- **FULL OUTER JOIN** ‚Üí Keep all rows from both tables.
- **CROSS JOIN** ‚Üí Use carefully; produces many rows.
- **SELF JOIN** ‚Üí Useful for comparing rows within the same table.
